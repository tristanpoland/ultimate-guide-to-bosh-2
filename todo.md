FinKit - Gareth Evans, Anouska

started with bosh.io - loads of information, but hard to know what to look for

Give users access to GCP, not to a BOSH on GCP.


Rona - `bbl` is the starting point; `bosh-deployment` is another (kubo-deployment is another).
Gives new users a BOSH director with running deployments rather than blank cloud or blank director.


As a chef person, what is BOSH?


When new ppl "get it"

* tried to kill machines but BOSH resurrector recreated them
* stemcell upgrade; and be able to explain exactly how the patching process works
* resizing VMs and the persistent data is still there
* resizing persistent disks


What is BOSH?!?
